# Introduction
Sound：Users are randomly assigned voices and audio features.

Visual：Users are randomly assigned colors.

INteraction：When lines from different users intersect, compression creates effects similar to ducking and sidechains. Furthermore, by limiting the pitch, the tonal harmony between the different users' voices is maintained, preserving a harmonious listening experience.
